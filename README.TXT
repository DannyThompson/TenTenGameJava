This is a project for CS360 - Object Oriented Programming class.

The goal was to implement the game "Ten Ten" in a text based environment.
To run, compile using "javac PlayTenTen.java". 
Then type "java PlayTenTen (dimension 1) (dimension 2)" with the two dimensions being the desired number of rows and columns.

Although the idea is to have 10 rows and 10 columns, you can play with however many you want.
